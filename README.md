# Roblox Auto Player Piano Script â€” MelvinSGjr Edition

> **Heads up!** This is a heavily modified fork of the original script by [jOaawd](https://github.com/jOaawd/Roblox-Python-AutoPlayer). All the cool base stuff is theirs â€” all the weird, human, and sarcastic stuff is mine (MelvinSGjr).

Welcome to the most human, most chaotic, and most beautiful Roblox piano bot you'll ever see. This is a heavily modified fork by **MelvinSGjr** (yep, that guy from GitHub) â€” now with 200% more realism, jazz, and human error.

## What's New?
- ðŸ¤– **Legit Mode 2.0** â€” Now your bot plays like a real person: random delays, micro-pauses, missed notes, and the occasional "oops, finger slipped". No more robotic perfection!
- ðŸŽ¹ **Auto-Simplify for Insane MIDIs** â€” If your MIDI is a Beethoven-level monster, the script will gracefully dumb it down: breaks up monster chords, skips impossible runs, and makes it sound like a real pianist (with only two hands, not eight).
- ðŸ§  **Humanization Everywhere** â€” Chords sometimes become arpeggios, fast passages get a little messy, and everything is just a bit more... alive.
- ðŸ’¡ All comments and code style are now in true MelvinSGjr fashion: sarcastic, concise, and (hopefully) helpful.

## Usage (For any Linux or Windows)
1. Put your midi files in MIDI folder.
2. Run a command `py playMIDI.py` or `python playMIDI.py` in CMD and let the magic happen.
3. Use hotkeys (see console) to control playback, speed, legit mode, and more.
4. Brag to your friends that your bot is more human than theirs.

## Controls
- `DELETE` â€” Play/Pause
- `HOME` â€” Rewind
- `END` â€” Advance
- `PAGE UP/DOWN` â€” Speed up/slow down
- `INSERT` â€” Toggle legit mode (become human, or at least try)
- `F5` â€” Reload song
- `ESC` â€” Exit

## Contributions
Want to make it even more human? PRs and issues are welcome. Just keep it fun and weird.

This is for fun, learning, and showing off. Don't use it to ruin anyone's day. Respect Roblox's Terms of Service. If you get caught, you don't know me. ;)

Happy (imperfect) playing! ðŸŽ¼
